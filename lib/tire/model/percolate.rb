      module ClassMethods

        # Set up the percolation when documents are being added to the index.
        #
        # Usage:
        #
        #     class Article
        #       # ...
        #       percolate!
        #     end
        #
        # First, you have to register a percolator query:
        #
        #     Article.index.register_percolator_query('fail')    { |query| query.string 'fail' }
        #
        # Then, when you update the index, matching queries are returned in the `matches` property:
        #
        #     p Article.create(:title => 'This is a FAIL!').matches
        #
        #
        # You may pass a pattern to filter which percolator queries will be executed.
        #
        # See <http://www.elasticsearch.org/guide/reference/api/index_.html> for more information.

          self

        #

        #       # ...
        #       on_percolate do

        #       end
        #     end
        #
        # Based on the response received in `matches`, you may choose to fire notifications,
        # increment counters, send out e-mail alerts, etc.
