module Tire
  module Search


    # Performs a "scroll" search request, which obtains a `scroll_id`
    # and keeps returning documents matching the passed query (or all documents) in batches.
    #
    # You may want to iterate over the batches being returned:
    #
    #     search = Tire::Search::Scroll.new('articles')
    #     search.each do |results|
    #       puts results.map(&:title)
    #     end
    #
    # The scroll object has a fully Enumerable-compatible interface, so you may
    # call methods like `map` or `each_with_index` on it.
    #
    # To iterate over individual documents, use the `each_document` method:
    #
    #     search.each_document do |document|
    #       puts document.title
    #     end
    #
    # You may limit the result set being returned by a regular Tire DSL query
    # (or a hash, if you prefer), passed as a second argument:
    #
    #     search = Tire::Search::Scroll.new('articles') do
    #       query { term 'author.exact', 'John Smith' }
    #     end
    #
    # The feature is also exposed in the Tire top-level DSL:
    #
    #     search = Tire.scroll 'articles' do
    #       query { term 'author.exact', 'John Smith' }
    #     end

        # the same way. With scan, ES does not return search results in the

        # confusing. This will probably be corrected in some future ES. See
        # this issue to follow progress on this change.
